            <p>“The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn …and change.”
            Carl Rogers</p>

            <p>“The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.”
            Mark Twain</p>

            <p>“Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen? I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding line, and no way of knowing how near the harbor was. “Light! Give me light!” was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light of love shone on me in that very hour.”
            Helen Keller</p>

            <p>“Be miserable. Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, it's always your choice.”
            Wayne Dyer</p>

            <p>“The difference between school and life? In school, you're taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you're given a test that teaches you a lesson.”
            Tom Bodett</p>

            <p>“We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself.”
            Lloyd Alexander</p>

            <p>“Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”

            <p>“If people did not do silly things, nothing intelligent would ever get done.”
            Ludwig Wittgenstein</p>

            <p>“We can easily manage if we will only take, each day, the burden appointed to it. But the load will be too heavy for us if we carry yesterday’s burden over again today, and then add the burden of the morrow before we are required to bear it.”
            John Newton </p>

            <p>“It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.”
            Albert Einstein</p>

            <p>“I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.”
